1) NEW CLASS
    - Make new class for the recipe as a whole
    - (I copied the Burger one, replacing words where necessary)

3) EDIT GAMESCREEN
    - From about line 108, add a new clickable for each new ingredient and finished recipe
    - (don't worry about the orderTextures at ~line155, those aren't used and are vestigial)
    - If necessary, add preparation code:
        - Frying, baking in oven, or chopping
