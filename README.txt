Thanks for playing Piazza Panic by Generic Games!

INSTRUCTIONS:
You select a cook with the number keys 1 or 2.
Each cook has a stack of 5 items they can carry, displayed on the right hand side of the screen.
Customers will enter your cafe and order a meal, which is displayed at the top left of the screen with a countdown.
Each meal consists of ingredients which must be prepared before being served:
	Patties must be fried and flipped
	Lettuce must be cut
	Tomatoes must be cut
In order to prepare an ingredient, you must carry it to the correct preparation station.
Once the cook is at the station, click the station again to start preparing the ingredient.
A green progress bar will appear, in this time the cook cannot move.
Once the bar dissapears, the cook can now move again.
Once all the ingredients have been prepped, the cook must be moved to the serving bench on the right side of the kitchen.
Here you can give a customer their order only if the selected cook is carrying all of the correct ingredients.
Click on the dish you wish to serve and the customer will automatically take it and leave!
If the countdown of the order finishes the player loses a reputation point, however the customer still waits to ber served.

1 - Select cook 1.
2 - Select cook 2.
